# Proj6_Graphs

From my Data Structures Class.

This is a set of two python programs each of which implements a Graph Data Structure. One implements a directed, weighted graph, and the other, an undirected, unweighted graph. 

Undirected Graph
---
The undirected, unweighted graph is represented as an adjacency list.
Methods:
* Add/Remove vertex
* Check path validity
* Depth-First Search
* Breadth-First Search
* Count connected components
* Cycle Detection

Directed Graph
---
The directed, weighted graph is represented as an adjacency matrix.
Methods:
* Add/Remove Vertex
* Add/Remove Edges
* Depth-First Search
* Breadth-First Search
* Cycle Detection
* Dijkstra's Algorithm
